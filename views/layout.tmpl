          h3 Minimal, yet a complete Package
          p
            | Declaire.js allows you to write a single web application that runs on both
            | client and server.
            br
            | Pages are first generated in a streaming fashion on the server
            | - for short time to first byte and easy SEO - and get rehydrated on the client
            | afterwards, using the same codebase.
          p
            | Declaire brings its own templating language, with a compact, Jade-inspired syntax
            | and a robust set of logic blocks for structuring your markup.
          p
            | RESTfull resources get served for your models automatically, without the need to write
            | additional code. Just define a data model, create instances and you're good to go.
          p
            | Stylesheets written in Stylus/nib are compiled and served automatically for you.
        
        li
          h3 Declarative
          p
            | The template is the highest authority in a Declaire application and manages most
            | application state for you. ViewModels get instantiated and deleted by the template engine
            | as neccessary when data changes, freeing you from having to manage memory and event
            | handlers yourself.
          p
            | Writing application code in this declarative way minimizes overhead and prevents many
            | common programming mistakes.
        
        li
          h3 Realtime Sync
          p
            | Model state is kept current with the remote database at all times automatically.
            | Declaire does this in a scalable fashion, without the need for an additional PubSub
            | server like Redis. A single MongoDB connection is sufficient for all data storage
            | and synchronization needs.
        
        li
          h3 Auto Bindings
          p
            | Watch the DOM magically update, as your model data changes. No matter if those changes
            | resulted from your own actions or from updates to the server.
        
        li
          h3 Computed Properties
          p
            | Computed properties are like regular model methods, except that they also emit change
            | events when one of the properties they depend on changes. This allow you to hook up
            | complex logic to templates in a completely declarative way.
            br
            | Dependency tracking happens automatically, without the need to declare these
            | relationships ahead of time.
        
        li
          h3 Offline First
          p
            | All Declaire applications work offline by default.
            | Data changes are kept in local browser storage when offline and get synced back to
            | the server later, when connectivity is available again.
            br
            | Application files are cached using an offline manifest by the framework.

        li
          h3 Streaming Server
          p
            | When templates get first rendered on the server, Declaire utilises Node.js' streaming technology
            | to transmit the first few bytes as soon as possible. Browsers can already display content
            | and start downloading additional resources, while the database is still returning data.
        
        li
          h3 Based on trusted Technology
          p
            | Declaire runs on Node.js and uses Express internally to serve requests.
            | Data is stored in a MongoDB instance, and code is packaged using Browserify.
            br
            | The express app, as well as the connected database instance are exposed to interested
            | applications just before listening for requests.
            | This allows you to hook up legacy code or load additional express middleware and make
            | changes to the database before serving requests.

        // Implicit router and offline handling through scope
        // Authentication and permission system
