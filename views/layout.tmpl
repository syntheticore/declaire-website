          h3 Full Stack
          p
            | Declaire.js allows you to write a single web application that runs on both
            | client and server.
          p
            | Pages are first generated in a streaming fashion on the server
            | - for short time to first byte and easy SEO - and get rehydrated on the client
            | afterwards, using the same codebase.
          p
            | Declaire brings its own templating language, with a compact, 
            a(href="http://jade-lang.com" target="_blank") Jade
            | -inspired syntax and a robust set of logic blocks for structuring your markup.
          p
            | RESTfull resources get served for your models automatically, without the need to write
            | additional code. Just define a data model, create instances and you're good to go.
          p
            | Stylesheets written in
            a(href="http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/" target="_blank") Stylus 
            | /
            a(href="http://tj.github.io/nib/" target="_blank") Nib 
            | are compiled and served automatically for you.
        
        li
          h3 Declarative
          p
            | The template is the highest authority in a Declaire application and manages most
            | application state for you.
          p
            | ViewModels get instantiated and deleted by the template engine
            | as neccessary when data changes, freeing you from having to manage memory and event
            | handlers yourself.
          p
            | Writing application code in this declarative way minimizes overhead and prevents many
            | common programming mistakes.
        
        li
          h3 Auto Bindings
          p
            | Watch the DOM magically update, as your model data changes. No matter if those changes
            | resulted from your own actions or from updates to the server.
        
        li
          h3 Computed Properties
          p
            | Computed properties are like regular model methods, except that they also emit change
            | events when one of the properties they depend on changes. This allow you to hook up
            | complex logic to templates in a completely declarative way.
          p
            | Dependency tracking happens automatically, without the need to declare these
            | relationships ahead of time.
        
        li
          h3 Realtime Sync
          p
            | Model state is kept current with the remote database at all times automatically.
          p
            | Declaire does this in a scalable fashion, without the need for an additional PubSub
            | server like 
            a(href="http://redis.io" target="_blank") Redis
            | . A single 
            a(href="http://mongodb.org" target="_blank") MongoDB 
            | connection is sufficient for all data storage and synchronization needs.
        
        li
          h3 Offline First
          p
            | All Declaire applications work offline by default.
            | Data changes are kept in local browser storage when offline and get synced back to
            | the server later, when connectivity is available again.

        li
          h3 Streaming Server
          p
            | When templates get first rendered on the server, Declaire utilises 
            a(href="http://nodejs.org" target="_blank") Node.js
            | ' streaming technology to transmit the first few bytes as soon as possible. Browsers can
            | already display content and start downloading additional resources, while the database
            | is still returning data.
        
        li
          h3 Based on trusted Technology
          p
            | Declaire runs on 
            a(href="http://nodejs.org" target="_blank") Node.js 
            | and uses 
            a(href="http://expressjs.com" target="_blank") Express 
            | internally to serve requests.
            | Data is stored in a 
            a(href="http://mongodb.org" target="_blank") MongoDB 
            | instance, and code is packaged using 
            a(href="http://browserify.org" target="_blank") Browserify
            | .
          p
            | The express app, as well as the connected database instance are exposed to interested
            | applications just before listening for requests.
            | This allows you to hook up legacy code or load additional 
            a(href="http://expressjs.com/resources/middleware.html" target="_blank") express middleware 
            | and make changes to the database before serving requests.

        li
          h3 Scalable
          p
            | Declaire scales up from very simple pages and prototypes to complex applications.
          p
            | Because of its full-stack, zero-config nature, applications are quickly
            | set up and running.
          p
            | Because of its declarative logic, flexible components and sane module system, Declaire
            | also keeps more complex applications maintainable and fast.
          p 
            | Declaire also scales horizontally and runs on an arbitrary number of Node instances.
            | Both session and push management are realised in a scalable fashion.

        li
          //- h3 Decidedly Web
          h3 ❤ ing the Web
          p
            | In the transition from server generated pages to single-page applications, some values
            | of the web have - I believe - been lost in translation.
          //- p
          //-   | Pages often only contain a small fragment of
          //-   | container html and generate everything else using javascript. Some frameworks these days
          //-   | even go as far as bypassing the http protocol completely and transmit everything over websockets.
          //- p
          //-   | This is not only problematic for search engines and comparatively slow when it comes to
          //-   | time to first impression, but also undermines the movement to semantic html somewhat,
          //-   | by relying on a "semantic DOM" that only high-powered, javascript-savy browser engines
          //-   | can still consume, instead of, say, a simple shell script.
          p
            | Declaire therefore delivers:
          ul.list
            li Full HTML source for every page, instead of just a few script tags.
            li Data over standard REST/JSON.
            li Push updates using Server-Sent-Events over standard HTTP instead of websockets.

        // Implicit router and offline handling through scope
        // Authentication and permission system

      article#templating
        h2 Templating
        p
          | Declaire's templating language borrows syntax heavily from 
          a(href="http://jade-lang.com" target="_blank") Jade 
          | and
          a(href="http://handlebarsjs.com" target="_blank") Handlebars

          a(href="https://github.com/raptorjs/marko" target="_blank") Marko 
          | and hooks natively into declaire's models and view models.
        p
          | Hierachy is denoted through indentation, interpolation uses curlies, statements use double
          | curlies and most other syntax adheres to HTML and CSS alot.
        p
          | Declaire uses a different evaluator on the client than on the server,
          | to process the exact same parse tree.
        p
          | The client evaluator operates directly on the DOM and creates, modifies and removes elements as neccessary
          | when data in your models or view models changes.
        p
          | The server evaluator generates ordinary html source from the same parse tree and data. It
          | does so in a fashion that minimizes time to first byte, by streaming rendered chunks of markup
          | to the client already, while it's still waiting for the database to return  further data.
          | The asynchronous resolution of data in the view models is also taken into account and

          | show up after the fact and trigger the appropriate events. A Query will also update
          | when one of the properties filtered over changes for one of the objects in the collection.
        p
          | Queries can be further narrowed down by calling the chainable filter function:
        pre(data-filename="app.js")

            | aboutSport.each(function(todo) {
            |   todo.remove();
            | });
        p We can use a Query in a computed property together with an input binding for creating a live search feature:
        pre(data-filename="app.js")

            | declaire.ViewModel('SearchUsersView', {
            |   people: declaire.Query(Person),

            |     // Filter works flawlessly on Person.name, btw,

            |       li {name}
        p
          | Here, the query property of the view model gets driven by its binding to the text input.

          | results to fire one as well, which causes the template engine to update the list of

          | The main model sits at the very bottom of every scope and gets created and updated
          | by the framework. It is not meant to be written to directly.
        p
          | It contains several properties of interest to
          a(href="#routing") routing
          | ,
          a(href="#offline") offline handling
          | ,
          a(href="#session") session
          | ,
          a(href="#components") components 
          | and potentially any application.
        section
          h4 _page
          p
            | Contains another complete model object that acts as a mirror for the current url.
            | Read its <b>route</b> and <b>params</b> properties to route your pages, or set them to navigate
            | from code.
          //- These get created dynamically and do not belong in the main model:
          //- h4 _params
          //- p
          //-   | Contains the parameters given to the import statement or view. Useful to delegate these to
          //-   | another view model.
          //- h4 _content
          //- p Contains markup nested below an import statement. Useful to customize reusable components.
          h4 _online
          p
            | Represents the current state of connectivity. Useful to show to user when his changes do
            | not currently reach the server.
          h4 _authenticated
          p Tells if the user is logged in.
          h4 _version
          p 
            | Changes as soon as a new version of the application is available and has been loaded
            | into the offline cache. This is a good point in time to inform the user that reloading the page
            | will bring new goodness.
          h4 _cookie
          p 
            | Contains another complete model object that acts as a mirror for the real browser session.
            | This allows you to use the cookie everywhere you can use a model.
        
        section
          h3 Accessing the Main Model Singleton Instance
          p As part of every scope, its underscored properties are available in any template.

      article#components
        h2 Organizing Templates and Components
        p
          | Declair uses a simple way to combine templates that also serves as a basis to build
          | reusable components:
          | Use the import instruction to import another template in the surrounding template.
        p
          | We can use this to refactor our todos app from above and
          | make the TodosView a reusable component that we can insert at multiple locations.
          br
          | Parameters passed to the imported template are delegated to the topmost node inside.
        pre(data-filename="views/TodosView.tmpl")
          code(class="handlebars")
            | {{view TodosView}}
            |   header
            |     h1 Todos
            |   main
            |     input(type="text" placeholder="What's next?" {{action change newTodo}})
            |     ul.todos
            |       {{for todos}}
            |         li
            |           input(type="checkbox" checked="{{done}}")
            |           h2 {title}
            |   footer {todos.length} items left to do
            //- |   .embed

      article#routing
        h2 Routing
        p
          | Declaire apps contain an implicit router, that lives as another model object inside the <b>_page</b>
          | property of the main model. This way, routing information is not only available to javascript,
          | but - because the main model lies at the base of every scope - to templates as well.
        p
          | Because it's a regular model object, it will emit change events when its
          | properties are written to, which are in turn caught by the template engine.
        pre(data-filename="views/layout.tmpl")
          code(class="handlebars")
            | body
            |   header
            |     h1 My Page
            |     nav>ul
            |       li>a(href="/") Home
            |       li>a(href="/pages/todos") Todos
            |   main
            |     {{if _page.route == '/'}}
            |       {{import IndexView}}
            |     {{if _page.route == '/pages/todos'}}
            |       {{import TodosView(_page.params)}}
        p If you want to access the router more directly, listen to its events using Javascript:
        pre(data-filename="app.js")
          code(class="javascript")
            | declaire.mainModel.get('_page').on('change:route', function(route) {
            |   console.log("The url changed to " + route);
            | });

      article#client-only
        h2 Running client- (or server-) only Code
        p
          | By default, all your code is executed on both server and client, leading to consistent results.
          | Sometimes though, this will not do the trick and you might want to execute code only on the one side
          | or the other. Declaire offers several ways to do this:
        p
          | Declaire accepts several hooks in its start method, that get executed at specific points
          | in time. Some on the server, some on the client. Consult the
          a(href="/pages/docs") docs 
          | for more detailed information!
        pre(data-filename="app.js")
          code(class="javascript")
            | console.log("Executed once on both client and server");
            |
            | declaire.start({
            |   beforeConnect: function(mainModel, express, mongoDB) {
            |     console.log("Executed only on the server");
            |   },
            |
            |   onLoad: function(mainModel) {
            |     console.log("Executed only on the client");
            |   }
            | });
        p
          | Declaire also provides helper methods to exclude arbitrary code segments, that can
          | be used both with a callback, or as a regular function:
        pre(data-filename="app.js")
          code(class="javascript")
            | // Continuation passing style
            | declaire.onServer(function() { });
            |
            | // Good ol' boolean function
            | if(declaire.onClient()) { }

      article#offline
        h2 Offline Support
        p
          | After the initial page load, Declaire apps can be reloaded - even across browser
          | restarts - when the device has no connection to the internet, by the virtue of a
          | framework generated offline manifest that is injected into your pages.
          br
          | Even when you are online, this will give your applications a serious boost on
          | subsequent loads. 
        p
          | Declaire also keeps a cache of checked out data models and can
          | silently retrieve any objects that had been loaded already from local storage,
          | without modifications to your code.
        p
          | Modifications to existing objects or newly created ones will be saved
          | locally until the server can be reached for synchronization again.
        p
          | All of this happens completely transparently to you. When your app needs to know
          | more about its internal state though, the 
          a(href="#main-model") main model 
          | contains several fields of interest.

      article#stylesheets
        h2 Stylesheets
        p
          | You can use anything you want of course, but by default, Declaire supports
          a(href="http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/") Stylus 
          | with 
          a(href="http://tj.github.io/nib/") Nib 
          | for writing your stylesheets.
          | These are great libraries and the indented syntax matches Declaire nicely.
          | Among lots of other functionality, they provide you with:
        pre(data-filename="stylesheets/main.styl")
          code(class="less")
            | // Server side imports
            | @require 'nib'

        p

        p
          | Declaire works as a standard 
          a(href="http://npmjs.com") NPM 
          | library and doesn't use any special protocols beside HTTP. You should therefore
          | be able to deploy your application anywhere where node applications run.
        p
          | Be sure to set the environment variable NODE_ENV to 'production' on production
          | systems, to disable development guides like automatic reparsing of templates.

            br

            a(href="http://heroku.com" target="_blank") Heroku
